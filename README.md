# jasmineInitializorClassTests
using jasmine as in [text](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/object-oriented-javascript/9781785880568/) with a class that is initialized with an object literal

This is a starting place for a simple project with tests. I introduced it (start of chapter 12) along with objects chapter 1, 4 and 8 as the minimal requirement for tdd with objects first.

To use this:

```
npm install
npm test
```

The test is in the spec folder. The unit under test is Person.js.
